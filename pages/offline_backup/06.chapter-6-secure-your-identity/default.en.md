![](/images/SECURE_Browsing.jpg)[Browsers’ Browser Browsers]

A web browser is a software application used to browse, search, and
display content on the World Wide Web. Today, some of the most popular
web browsers, like Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome
are installed on most operating systems. And it is easy to notice the
increasing threat coming from online criminals that try to take
advantage of web browsers and their vulnerabilities. Some of the biggest
networks, like Google, also have the ability to keep tracking you even
when you're not signed in or on their page and follow you around the
Internet to serve you with "relevant" advertising and content. Since
almost everyone on the Internet has some sort of account with a Google
service, one can only imagine, the amount of data on civilians they
hold.

So, securing our browser is one of the first steps we need to take in
order to assure our online protection. Here are a few things you can do:

-   Customize the settings on your browser for maximum security
-   Add security extensions to your browser
-   Use Alternative Search Engines

    Changing your default browser settings will give you more control
    over who has access to your data.

    [Google Chrome]

    In recent years, the use of the Google Chrome web browser has
    significantly increased. As more and more people use it, there are a
    few actions we can take to also increase our online security.

    To start making the necessary modifications, we need to access the
    settings area. Please make the necessary changes in case you are
    using a different version of Google Chrome.

EXTENSIONS]![](/images/Incognito_window.png)![](/images/Incognito_window1.png)
[Chrome → → Select "New Incognito Window"]

Using Chrome's Incognito Mode means that when you close your browser, a
number of traces created during the session are automatically cleared:
your browser, search, web form and download histories, as well as
cookies and temporary files.-   What is saved and deleted when you close the browser is already
    predefined—you can't customize 'private browsing mode' to suit your
    own needs.
-   Only your browser history from this incognito session will be
    cleared. Your history from previous browsing sessions in 'normal
    mode' are unaffected.
-   Trackers in the websites you visit can still collect data about you,
    including your browser history.
-   Incognito mode does not give you anonymity on the Internet.

To access the settings area for Google Chrome, click the button at the
top right corner of the browser and select [Settings
]from the drop-down menu.

As soon as you access the Settings area, you will notice [Advanced Sync
Settings ]at the top, in the Sign-in section.![](/images/New_incognito_window.png)![](/images/New_incognito_window1.png)

with other systems or mobile devices where you signed-in with your
Google account. This does create a vulnerability risk, since you are
required by default to connect with your Google account on a device that
also syncs with your other systems or devices.

To improve your security, you need to set a passphrase, which is an
additional credential required to sync your devices.

If you scroll down at the bottom of the page, you will see a [Show
Advanced Settings] option.

Click the link in order to access the advanced settings available.

The [Clear Browsing Data] option gives you the
possibility to delete your browsing history, so don’t forget to use that
option if you are using a computer in a shared environment.

If you want to restrict cookies from being stored on your browser and
using the collected information about your browsing habits, use the
available options.

To make the necessary changes in the [Content
settings] window, you will need to scroll down in
order to access the other options.![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-18_at_11.13.20_AM.png)

Scrolling down, you find other options: You can control the behavior of
your browser plug-ins, you can block pop-ups from disturbing your
browsing session and you can stop a website from tracking your physical
location.

If you continue scrolling down to the bottom of the [Content
settings] window, you will find the option to block
websites from using a plugin to access your computer. There is also an
option to block sites from downloading multiple files automatically on
your computer, This can also further protect you from being exposed to
sites that try to deposit security threats on to your device.

[Mozilla Firefox]

Mozilla Firefox is another popular web browser and there are a few steps
we can take to improve its security settings. To increase your
protection against online threats in Mozilla Firefox (version 32.0.2),
you need to access the settings area.

[Private Browsing] allows you to browse the
Internet without Firefox saving any information in your browser history.
You can set Private Browsing by default, or you can use it only
occasionally.
Setting private browsing by default can be done in two ways:

1\. Find [multiple → → Preferences → Privacy → select Never remember
history]

or

2\. [Firefox → → Preferences → Privacy → select use custom settings for
history → check: Always use private browsing mode]

When you close Firefox, the following will be cleared: your browser,
search, web form and download histories, as well as cookies and
temporary files.

-   What will be saved and what will be deleted is already
    predefined—you can't customize 'private browsing mode' to suit your
    own needs.
-   Your history will only be cleared when you close the browser
-   The trackers in the websites you visit can still collect data about
    you, including your browser history.
-   Private browsing excludes the files you download and the pages you
    bookmark. These are saved.
-   Private Browsing [does not make you anonymous on the
    internet].

    [Using Private Browsing occasionally]

    Private Browsing' mode can also be used for a single window: [Open
    Firefox → → New Private Window]

In the [Options] window, you need to access first
the [General] category from the top menu.

Under this section, you can select the option “[Always ask me where to
save files]”. This way, you won’t have a web
location trying to automatically save dangerous content to your
computer. At the same time, you have the option to place suspicious
content in a location where you can analyze it afterwards.![](/images/fire_fox_1.png)

[NOTE:] Please make the necessary changes in case
you are using a different version of Mozilla Firefox. To access the
settings area, select[ ][Tools and
Options.]
In the Tracking section, check “[Tell sites that I do not want to be
tracked].” Selecting this option informs a website
that you would like to opt-out of third-party tracking for advertising
purposes. In the “[History]” section, choose your
browser [Never remember history], especially if you
are using a computer from a public location or you know that computer is
used by more people.

For a more detailed configuration of your [History]
section, select from the drop-down menu Use custom settings for history.

You can choose for example, to [always use private browsing
mode], which we highly recommend if you find
yourself in a shared environment. Selecting this option ensures that
when you finish your Mozilla Firefox session, all browsing, search and
download history, and all the cookies are removed. For a more detailed
configuration of your online browsing settings, choose from the

[Internet Explorer]

Microsoft Internet Explorer27 is one of the most used web browsers in
the world since it arrives pre-installed in our Windows operating
systems. It supports Java and other active content, and it also
implements ActiveX technology. While it is not the safest, and in fact,
we do not recommend it at all, if you must use it, we recommend the
following changes.

You can start a private browsing session in Internet Explorer (also
called InPrivate Browsing).

Click on [Settings → Safety → InPrivate Browsing].
You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P to launch it.
Alternatively, you can right-click on the IE taskbar icon and select
[Start InPrivate Browsing].![](/images/Internet_Explorer_1.png)

[https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/ultimate-guide-secure-online-browsing/]{._Hyperlink}[NOTE:] To improve your overall security
configuration in Windows 11, you need to access your browser settings
area. Please make the necessary changes in case you are using a
different version of Internet Explorer.To improve your Internet Explorer settings, access the [Internet Options
]area.

Go to the [Security] tab from the top menu.

In this area you can locate: [Your trusted sites and security
zones] for your computer. You also have the
possibility to customize each security zone.
![](/images/103.png)
![](/images/Internet_Explorer_3.png)
![](/images/Internet_Explorer_31.png)

For the Internet zone we recommend selecting the [High security
level]. This selection will disable some browser
features, such as ActiveX, Active scripting and Java, which can act as
security breaches creating opening for threats to occur.

To customize the security settings for a zone, choose the [Custom Level
]option.

In this area you can enable or disable specific security options for
your selected Internet area. To return to the default levels for the
selected Internet zone, simply click the “Reset” button.

If we return to the initial window and click the [Trusted sites
]option, we find a security zone for sites which
are safe to access.

If you consider a particular website to be a safe online location that
can be trusted, you can choose to add it to this area. To do this, click
[Sites].![](/images/Internet_Explorer_4.png)
![](/images/Internet_Explorer_41.png)
![](/images/Internet_Explorer_5.png)
![](/images/Internet_Explorer_51.png)
In this area, you can choose to add the website to a list of safe web
locations. You can also choose to remove a site from the list.

The [Trusted sites ]zone is useful if you chose the
High security level for the Internet zone. Setting the High security
level in the Internet zone causes browser features like ActiveX and
Active scripting to stop functioning, and you may encounter some
websites that don’t function normally after that. To solve this, simply
go to the Trusted sites zone and add the site that doesn’t function as
it should. Adding the site to the Trusted sites zone means that the
website will work normally, by loading the browser features that are not
allowed to function in the High security level.

The [Privacy ]tab contains various settings for
cookies in Internet Explorer.

Cookies are text files that are placed in your computer by websites you
access. They contain data and information the sites store about your
browsing habits or your preferences. In this space you can use the
preset privacy rules available by using the slider and select one of the
settings for your Internet zone. For example, choosing the High level
will block cookies from most websites.

If you want to make modifications, you have other additional options.

To improve your security, select the [Advanced
]button available.

This area contains settings that apply to all security zones.

From this tab, we recommend you to [uncheck Enable third-party browser
extensions ]option.

If you leave it checked, different types of toolbars and addons are
enabled on your system and this may affect your privacy. Many add-ons
have proved to monitor your browsing habits or even attempt to collect
private data from your browser.![](/images/Internet_Explorer_8.png)

Adjusting your browser settings will enhance its security to a certain
degree, but for complete protection installing further security
extensions will be needed.28

Browser extensions are small software programs that improve and
personalize your online experience.

With so many extensions (or add-ons) out there, it is difficult to make
the right choice. Some of them address your need for privacy, others,
your need for protection and security while you access your online tax
information or log into your banking account, for example.

When using a browser extension you have greater control over your
browser behavior. You can block ads from some websites and pop-ups that
may act like carriers for financial and data stealing malware. At the
same time, you have the possibility to block others from breaching your
privacy settings.

[Privacy Badger]

[EFF's ]{._Hyperlink}[[Privacy Badger]{._Hyperlink}]() is a browser
add-on that stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from
secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at.

If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple websites
without your permission, Privacy badger automatically blocks that
advertiser from loading any more content.

To the advertiser, it's like you suddenly disappeared. Privacy Badger
was born out of the desire to be able to recommend a single extension
that would automatically analyze and block any tracker or ad that
violated the principle of user consent.

Although extensions like Disconnect, Adblock Plus, Ghostery work well,
(in fact Privacy Badger is based on the ABP code!), all of them require
some custom configuration to block non-consensual trackers and could
have some conflict of interests in their business model.[Extensions for a SAFER online session][TIP:] We want you to also be aware how these
extensions work to provide security and also how to test these
extensions

The Internet freedom non-profit EFF developed Privacy Badger to be
heuristic, which means it gets better at creating blacklists and
blocking websites as time goes on, making it unique when compared to
other blockers. Out of the box, Privacy Badger won’t block nearly as
many third-party requests as the commercial options but it does get
better over time with frequent use. It will discover which hosts to
block, it will also create a whitelist for important sites that are
visited on a regular basis.

[HTTPS EVERYWHERE]

[HTTPS Everywhere] is an extension available for
Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome created by the Electronic Frontier
Foundation.

![](/images/https_everywhere.png)
![](/images/https_everywhere1.png)

[Web of Trust]

Available for Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer,
[Web Of Trust] ranks websites by reputation based
on the amount of malware they host or tracking cookies they contain.
Since it's an informational tool, it will not block ads, but its
valuable information allows you to make an informed decision on your
course of action.

Search Engines are big money for Google and Microsoft because what you
search tells a lot about you and what your concerns are. Imagine if I
search in one session about the cost of diapers, maternity centers, and
child care, one could easily infer that I was thinking about children.
Similarly if you are about to hold a protest and you search about
non-violent direct action or the number for the lawyers guild, one could
then infer you were thinking about a protest or some direct action. In
essence who ever owns your search history owns you!

This is why choosing a search engine that does not track you is
important. Currently all of your searches on engines like Google and
Bing are used to help inform and create a very large Data shadow about
you and your concerns. Imagine what that could reveal and how it could
be used against you. The best option then is to use search engines that
do not track you.

We recommend [DuckDuckGo]29[,]
but for folks who want to see a comparison the next page has some great
options to explore. Try them and try them often. Once you find one that
