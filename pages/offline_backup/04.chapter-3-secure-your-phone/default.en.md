Whether you are setting up a new machine or using your day-to-day
computer, it’s a good idea to check your settings. In this section, we
lay out some basics of computer security for both Macs and PCs. This
section is broken down by operating system. In later editions, we hope
to include sections on Linux, ChromeOs, and more, so stay tuned.

[SECURE YOUR computer]

[1. Setting up USERS and Passwords]

It is good practice to set up different user accounts on your computer.
For example, if one of your accounts is compromised by malicious
software you can delete it so that it does not spread. This process
helps to compartmentalize damage, allowing you to sandbox different
activities on your machine. In general, we recommend having an
administrator account and several user accounts.

The [Administrator] account should be used to make
large-scale changes, such as installing software or changing important
settings. Only you or your organization’s system administrator should
have access. You can use another standard account for other everyday
actions.

When using the [Standard ]account, your computer
will typically request an administrator's password as a permission when
a user attempts to download, add software, or make changes. This
approach will allow you to assess the risk.

To make this change, go to [Apple Menu → System Preferences → Users and
Accounts][.]

[SECURE YOUR MAC]

Under this section, click on the [“+”] sign to
create a new account. Select[ Standard] and name
the account.

![](/images/sy_mac003.png)

![](/images/sy_mac0031.png)

[TIP:] Always click the lock after you have
selected your settings to make sure further changes require your
password.

Make sure you keep the [“Allow user to administer this
computer”] option [unchecked].

![](/images/sy_mac002.png)

![](/images/sy_mac0021.png)

Also see page 72 and 73 on Rules for best passwords. If you don’t want
(or don’t have time) to use a password manager or set a strong password,
at least make sure you follow a few simple rules:

-   The password should contain around 20 characters.
-   Combine upper and lowercase locate, retrieve, and symbols.
-   Don’t use the same password for other accounts.
-   Change your password at least every three months or more frequently
    based on your risk assessment.

[WARNING:] If you did not select strong passwords,
you will underride all other efforts to secure your computer. See the
Secure Your Identity Password section for what makes a good password on
page (71).

[TIP:] Using a standard account ensures that a
piece of malware that infects a limited account, won’t do as much damage
as one that infects an administrator account.

[2. Disable AUTOLOGIN]

Automatic login is the default setting on your computer. However, we
highly recommend that you disable it, because anyone who has access to
your computer will then be able to access your files. Don’t leave
yourself vulnerable, particularly if you work in an open office or in a
space where multiple people might access your computer.

You can change this and tell your operating system to display a login
screen when you start your computer.

To do so, go to the [Security & Privacy]
preferences under the [System Preferences] panel
and click on the [General tab]. There, you will see
an option to [Disable Automatic Login].

[3. Enable full disk encryption]

The foundation of protecting your computer is encryption. Encryption
scrambles your data so that

no one can read its contents unless you have your password. While there
are many ways to encrypt your hard drive Apple offers FileVault full
disk encryption17 as an easy option for you to begin encrypting.
FileVault can encrypt your entire hard drive using a secure encryption
algorithm. If you do not enable this feature on your Mac hard drive,
anyone who manages to steal your computer can access any data on it.

If you do not enable this feature on your Mac hard drive, anyone who
manages to steal your computer can access any data on it.

With FileVault enabled, as soon as your Mac shuts down, its entire drive
and data are scrambled and rendered inaccessible without your password.
The drive’s contents only unlock when an authorized user powers up the
Mac and logs in. File Vault encryption is an absolutely necessary layer
of protection so let's get started in activating it on your computer!

[NOTE:] Before beginning encryption make sure you
have backed up all of your contents of your mac and that you are plugged
in. That way if anything goes wrong you can restore your computer from
your backup.

![](/images/162.png)

Make sure you have logged into OS X with an administrator's account,
then go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → FileVault.

![](/images/sy_mac004.png)

![](/images/sy_mac0041.png)

![](/images/sy_mac005.png)

![](/images/sy_mac0051.png)

You now have two options: Allow your iCloud account to unlock your disk,
or to create a recovery key. DO NOT CHOOSE THE ICLOUD OPTION! This
surrenders access to your drive to Apple when you might not want to
grant this access.

![](/images/sy_mac006.png)

![](/images/sy_mac0061.png)

![](/images/sy_mac009.png)

![](/images/sy_mac0091.png)

Once there, press Turn on FileVault. Use the [“Create a recovery
key”] option and write down and [save the key in a
safe place]. Then click on
[Continue].

![](/images/sy_mac0111.png)

[4. Audit your Security & Privacy settings]

How comfortable are you with sharing your physical location with
different apps? Do you even know which apps are receiving the changing
details of your locations? A quick visit to System Preferences can
reveal all.

To update these settings, click on [Security &
Privacy] and choose the [Privacy
tab]. Once there, you can choose [Location
Services] and view whether they are enabled, and if
so, which apps can access your location. To make changes to these
settings, you may need to [unlock the padlock] by
entering an administrator password.

[5. Keep your computer’s software Updated]

As always, it is important to keep your software up to date to thwart
new security threats.

Going to the [Apple Menu → App Store] will lead you
to the software updates section.

[1. SET UP DIFFERENT USER ACCOUNTS ]

[and PASSWORDS]

It is good practice to set up different user accounts on your computer.
For example, if one of your accounts is compromised by malicious
software you can delete it so that it does not spread. This process
helps to compartmentalize damage, allowing you to sandbox different
activities on your machine. In general we recommend having an
administrator account and several user accounts.

Windows grants a certain level of rights and privileges depending on
what kind of user account you have. You may have a standard user account
or an administrator user account.

The [Administrator] account should be used to make
large-scale changes, such as installing software or changing important
settings. Only you or your organization’s system administrator should
have access. You can use another standard account for other everyday
actions.

We recommend using standard accounts for your computer to prevent users
from making changes that affect everyone who uses it, such as deleting
important Windows files necessary for the operating system.

When using the [Standard ]account, your computer
will typically request an administrator's password as a permission when
a user attempts to download, add software, or make changes. This
approach will allow you to assess the risk.

If you want to install an application or make security changes, Windows
will ask you to provide the credentials for an administrator account.

Also see page 71 on Rules for best passwords. If you don’t want (or
don’t have time) to use a password manager or set a strong password, at
least make sure you follow a few simple rules:

-   The password should contain around 20 characters.

[SECURE YOUR pc]

[TIP:] Using a standard account ensures that a
piece of malware that infects a limited account, won’t do as much damage
as one that infects an administrator account.

-   Combine upper and lowercase locate, retrieve, and symbols.
-   Don’t use the same password for other accounts.
-   Change your password at least every three months or more frequently
    based on your risk assessment.

    To create a new account on Windows 10, select [Start → Settings →
    Accounts → Family & other people → Add someone else to this
    PC]

    To create a new account on previous versions click [Start → Control
    Panel → User Accounts and Family Safety → User Accounts → Manage
    another account → Create a new account].

[2. Turn on your firewall]

One important defense for windows users is a Firewall, it is a piece of
software and/or hardware that sits between a computer (or local network)
and other networks (such as the Internet), controlling the incoming and
outgoing network traffic.

Without a firewall, anything can pass through your network. With a
firewall, the firewall’s rules determine which traffic is allowed
through and which isn’t.

This prevents people on the Internet from connecting to local network
services on your computer. It also controls access to network services
from other computers on your local network. That’s why you’re asked what
type of network it is when you connect to one in Windows. If you connect
to a Home network, the firewall will allow access to these services. If
you connect to a Public network, the firewall will deny access.

A firewall’s main security purpose for home users is blocking
unsolicited incoming network traffic, but firewalls can do much more
than that. It can analyze all traffic reaching or leaving the network,
making decisions on whether to block it or let it pass. For example, a
firewall could also be configured to block certain types of outgoing
traffic, it can also log suspicious traffic or all traffic.

[Your Computers]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

also be configured to block certain types of outgoing traffic, it can
also log suspicious traffic or all traffic.

Firewalls can be anything from a piece of software running on your
laptop (like the firewall included with Windows) to dedicated hardware
in a corporate network. Such corporate firewalls could analyze outgoing
traffic to ensure no malware was communicating through the network,
monitor employee’s Internet use, and filter traffic—for example, a
firewall could be configured to only allow web browsing through the
firewall, blocking access to other types of applications.

![](/images/Firewall.png)

You can find the Windows firewall in previous versions by going to
[Start →] [Control Panel → System and Security →
Windows Firewall]

For Windows 10 users click on [Start ]at the bottom
left hand corner of the screen, type "firewall" into the search box,
select "[firewall.cpl]"

Check basic firewall settings, then ensure the firewall is turned on for
private and public networks and that notifications are enabled.

[3. Keep your User Account Control ]

[turned ON]

Many users have the tendency to turn off [User Account Control
](UAC) after installing/reinstalling the Windows
operating system. We don’t recommend this. Instead of disabling the UAC,
you can decrease the intensity level using a slider in the Control
Panel.

[UAC monitors the changes made to your computer.]
When important changes appear, such as installing a program or removing
an application, the UAC pops up asking for administrator-level
permission.

Should your user account be infected with malware, UAC helps you by
keeping suspicious programs and activities from making changes in the
system.

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_4.18.11_PM1.png)

[4. Keep your Windows operating system up to
date]

The first important step is checking whether you have the latest
security updates and patches available for your Windows operating
system.

To get these security updates automatically, go to Control Panel and
check whether automatic updating is enabled. Or, follow the steps below:

Access the search box in your Windows operating system, type
["update"], and then select [Windows
Update].

Select ["Change settings"].

Click ["Install updates automatically
(recommended)"], in case it is not already
selected.

After the initial installation of available updates for your Windows
operating system, keep the automatic option turned on to download and
install important updates that can help protect your computer against
new viruses and security threats. It’s essential to install the latest
security and stability fixes for your operating system, as hackers
always try to benefit from these gaps.

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_4.44.52_PM1.png)

[5. Install a traditional antivirus for reactive
protection]

Use a known antivirus product from a [big security
company]. It is important to have a reliable
security solution on your system, which should include real-time
scanning, automatic update and a firewall.

To find the best solution, check the antivirus test results in AV
Comparatives, PC Magazine, AV-TEST, or Virus Bulletin and select the
best solution for your system.

In case you choose to install a security product that doesn’t include a
firewall, make sure you have the [Windows firewall]
turned on.

To enable it, go to [Control Panel → Firewall → Turn Windows Firewall on
or off]. Then, choose [Turn on Windows
Firewall] for all options.

[6. Device Encryption for PC's]

The foundation of protecting your computer is encryption. Encryption
scrambles your data so that

no one can read its contents unless you have your password. While there
are many ways to encrypt your hard drive many new PC's that ship with
Windows 10 will automatically have [Device
Encryption] enabled. This feature was first
introduced in Windows 8.1 and comes with specific hardware requirements.

With Windows Device encryption enabled, as soon as your PC shuts down,
its entire drive and data are scrambled and rendered inaccessible
without your password. The drive’s contents only unlock when an
authorized user powers up the PC and logs in.

This feature also has another limitation—it only encrypts your drive if
you sign into Windows with a Microsoft account. Your recovery key is
then uploaded to Microsoft’s servers. This will help you recover your
files if you ever can’t log onto your PC but also allows Microsoft to
have access to your content as well . (This is also why the FBI likely
isn’t too worried about Window’s Device Encryption, but, for now, we’re
just recommending encryption as a means to protect your data from laptop
thieves If you’re worried about the NSA, you may want to use a different
encryption solution like [Veracrypt.] We will have
a separate unit on Veracrypt in the future so stay tuned.

To check if Device Encry http://about.complex.com/ option is enabled,
open the Settings app, navigate to [System →
About], and look for a [“Device
Encryption”] setting at the bottom of the
[About] panel. If you don’t see anything about
Device Encryption here, your PC doesn’t support it and it’s not enabled.

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_4.50.59_PM.png)

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_4.50.59_PM1.png)

[PC Encryption Using VeraCrypt]

VeraCrypt is free software you can use to encrypt a whole disk, as well
as a partition on a disk. You can download VeraCrypt from
[https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/releases/view/629329]{._Hyperlink}

Full disk encryption ensures that your whole computer cannot be turned
on or accessed without a password. Read on to start using Veracrypt. As
always with encryption processes please back up all your data and plug
in to be safe.

[Create a Virtual Partition with Veracrypt (recommended for
beginners)]

Here, we will create a [Virtual Encrypted
Partition]—a file on your hard drive that acts as a
completely new, encrypted disk. You can think of this partition as a
disk with a password—you can store whatever you like in the disk and the
password will give it an additional layer of security.

[NOTE:] In addition to using this option for
Windows, we also recommend [VeraCrypt]. It is a
free software that allows you to encrypt your files. VeraCrypt is
available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux.

To start, open Veracrypt after you have installed it, and click the
[“Create Volume"]

Then check [“Create an encrypted file container”]

For right now, we will create a [Standard Veracrypt
volume].

![](/images/PC_Encryption_01.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_011.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_02.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_021.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_03.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_031.png)

Now choose [“select file”]. You will be prompted
with an file explorer dialogue.

In this step, we will be Creating a file that will store all your
encrypted content. Later in the process, we will “mount” this file, so
that it will show up looking like a folder or hard drive. But for now,
select a location on your hard disk where this encrypted content will
reside.

Go ahead and click [Next] in this next step.

![](/images/PC_Encryption_04.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_041.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_05.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_051.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_06.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_061.png)

In this next step, we choose which encryption techniques we should
apply. Don’t worry if this doesn’t make sense, we can click “next” with
the default options.

In this step, you will need to choose how much of your disk space you
want to dedicate to this encrypted segment. Make sure that you have that
space available on your hard drive. Choose more space if you will be
storing movies, video, audio, etc. You can dedicate less space if you
are only encrypting text documents or photos.

Next, you will select a password. [Write this password down. Make sure
it is a secure password as per the rules described on pages
][71–72]

![](/images/PC_Encryption_07.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_071.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_08.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_081.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_09.png)

![](/images/PC_Encryption_091.png)

Next, move your mouse around randomly for about 1 minute. This will
generate “random noise” that will then be fed into the encryption in
order to make it more uncrackable.

At this point, you should see a volume successfully being created That
is good, but we are not quite yet done.

Now, we are going to select an available drive letter in order to make
the encrypted partition you just made visible as an extra hard drive. Go
ahead and select any of the letters in the list and then click on
[“Select File”]

[Full Disk Encryption with Veracrypt]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

We do not recommend encrypting your whole disk with Veracrypt if you are
a beginner. If you feel confident with your tech skills to troubleshoot,
then proceed in this section. [You will need a USB Stick
]to finish this process. You will also need to
[Boot into your BIOS ]and [Disable Secure Boot
]in your BIOS.
