![](/images/SECURE_YOUR__Phone.jpg)



Your phone is one of the most critical components of your digital
ecosystem. Phones are essential to communication, strategizing, and
community organization. Most people communicate primarily through their
mobile phone, followed by their computers and tablets. However, for
these very reasons, governments and corporations throughout the world
use data collected through our phones to perform extensive surveillance.

As useful as it is, your phone can present pathways to serious
violations of your privacy and security. Below is a graphic that shares
all the different ways it collects and shares your personal data with
cell phone service providers and phone manufactures. This vulnerability
may allow governments and hackers to access information about your
physical location at any time, [even when it’s turned
off].

[A SECURE PHONE IS ALWAYS THE FOUNDATION!]

[WARNING:] Governments or malicious actors can turn
on your phone’s microphone and camera to listen to you even when the
device is turned off?

Your phone is one of the most critical components of your digital
ecosystem. Phones are essential to communication, strategizing, and
community organization. Most people communicate primarily through their
mobile phone, followed by their computers and tablets. However, for
these very reasons, governments and corporations throughout the world
use data collected through our phones to perform extensive surveillance.

As useful as it is, your phone can present pathways to serious
violations of your privacy and security. It also provides governments
and hackers with information about your physical location at any time,
[even when it’s turned off]. Below is a graphic
that shares all the different kinds of

data and information that your phone collects and shares with your cell
phone service provider and the company manufacturer that made phone.
This data can also be use and collected by the government.

Today, law enforcement agencies use technology that provide police with
data about the identity, activity, and location of any phone that
connects to targeted cell phone towers over a set span of time. A
typical broad data search covers multiple towers and wireless providers
and can net information from thousands of phones—without need for
warrants.10

Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and
Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), say that the power of even
small-town police departments to quickly obtain cell phone data results
in the erosion of privacy and the violation of Fourth Amendment
protections against unreasonable search and seizure. But thanks to a
unanimous Supreme Court decision in Riley v. California, this practice
is now officially legal.11

In extreme circumstances, [to prevent all tracking of your location from
your phone, shut it down completely and remove the battery. This is the
easiest way to ensure that you can't be tracked],

But it comes at the price of not being able to use your phone at all. If
you need access to any data on your phone, back it up to a computer
before you power down your device.

If your phone’s battery cannot be removed, place it in a [Faraday
bag,] which blocks transmission with its internal
lining.12 Not all faraday bags are created equal, so make sure you try
it out before you put it into use in everyday life. You want to confirm
that, at a minimum, cell and GPS services are blocked.

In addition to these scenarios, we face threats of information leaks
during the everyday use of our phones. There are several simple safe
practices that can be adopted to keep ourselves and our information
safe. In the following section, we will explore a few of them.

[NOTE:] The "Secure Your Phone" section is broken
up to address actions for Androids and iPhones separately. Please find
the section that works for your device and begin.

[1. LOCK YOUR SIM]

If your phone uses a SIM card, you can set a lock on the card so it
cannot be used by anyone who does not know the code. If your SIM is
stolen, this measure can protect your identity.

Enable Lock SIM card by going to [Settings → Personal → Security → Set
up SIM card lock]. Now, each time your phone is
turned on it will require a PIN in order to unlock your SIM card. No one
will be able to make calls using your device without the PIN.

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_10.12.21_AM1.png)

[SECURE YOUR ANDROID]



[NOTE:] We highly recommend that people [DO NOT
]use the fingerprint login, as you could be forced
or manipulated into putting your finger on your screen. There are also
more legal protections for the PIN versus the fingerprint login or even
swipe access to one's phone. Finally, it is never a good idea to give
your biometric data like a fingerprint to a corporation if you can avoid
it. So when in doubt use a PIN!

[2. SET UP YOUR PIN AND ACTIVATE A
SCREENLOCK]

Set up a screen lock by accessing [Settings → Personal → Security →
Screen Lock], to ensure that lists, pictures, and a
code, pattern, or password need to be entered in order to unlock the
screen.

We recommended using the PIN or password option, as these are more
obstructive to law enforcement or adversaries than a fingerprint ID.
This measure is particularly important in the event that you are faced
with a casual search by police or other authorities.

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_11.06.17_AM.png)

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_11.06.17_AM1.png)

[3. ACTIVATE a SECURITY LOCK TIMER]

Set the security lock timer, which will automatically lock your phone
after a certain amount of time.

Go to [Settings → Display → Sleep. ]Different
versions of the firmware use different names for this menu so you will
have to find the one that matches your phone.

Now select a time period that is appropriate to your usage habits in the
pop-up menu that appears. The change will take place immediately.

For maximum security, always choose the shortest possible time frame
that suits you without becoming too taxing. You can always adapt your
times to your activities as well. So if you use your phone for recipes
keep security lock timer off, but then turn it back on when you resume
regular activity. Use your risk assessment to figure out what makes the
most sense for you.

[4. Android Encryption]

With Androids, encrypting your phone is one of the best ways to protect
your data if the device is ever stolen, seized, or confiscated. The
purpose of encryption is to ensure that only someone who is authorized
to access your phone’s data will be able to read it using the decryption
key.

When your phone is encrypted, its data is stored in an unreadable,
seemingly scrambled form. If your phone is stolen, confiscated, or lost,
this feature can protect data like your home address, email, bank
accounts, communications, etc.

When you enter your PIN or your pattern on the lock screen, your phone
decrypts the data, making it understandable and accessible to you.
Without the encryption PIN or password, a malicious actor can’t access
your data. This is why Encryption is one of key building blocks of
securing your phone.

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_11.10.14_AM.png)



[NOTE:] Before starting the encryption process,
ensure your phone is backed up, fully charged, and plugged into a power
source. This ensures that the encrypting process is not interrupted. If
it is interrupted, and your data is lost or damaged, you will have a
backup of all of your data.

To begin encryption find out whether or not your Android has Encryption
enabled. Some versions of Android come with Encryption already set up
while others need to set it up manually. To discover where your phone is
at please first visit [Settings → Personal → Security →
Encryption].

If Encryption is enabled it will say it here clearly. If not then your
next step will require you to set a screen lock password (described
above).

Once your PIN is selected make sure you phone is fully charged and
backed up as you will not want to disturb the Encryption process. A back
up also ensures that if anything goes wrong during encryption that your
data is protected and your phone can be restored.

Once the phone is ready and plugged in, please begin Encrypting by
hitting Encrypt. The process should last anywhere from 30min to a couple
of hours.

[5. ADJUST YOUR NETWORK SETTINGS]

We recommend keeping most networks turned off and only manually enabling
them when necessary. One example is Bluetooth. Also, ensure that
tethering and portable hotspots are switched off when not in use.

If your device supports Near Field Communication (NFC), it will be
switched on by default and must be disabled manually.

[6. YOUR LOCATION SETTINGS]

[NOTE:] Only turn on location settings if
necessary. When these services aren’t running by default in the
background, it reduces the risk of location tracking, saves battery
power, and prevents unwanted data streams initiated by applications or
your mobile carrier.

Do so by accessing [Settings → Wireless & Networks → More → Tethering &
Mobile Hotspot].

Switch off wireless and GPS location (under Location Services) and
mobile data (under [Settings → Personal →
Location])

[Hiding Caller ID]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

You can hide your phone number from showing up to the person you are
calling. However, you should note that your phone carrier and legal
authorities will still have full access to logs showing who you called
and when.

[7. UPDATE YOUR Android]

To ensure that your phone remains secure, we strongly recommend you keep
your software updated. There are two types of updates to check for:

[NOTE:] It is important to always update your
phone’s software from a trusted location—such as your Internet
connection at home—somewhere like an Internet cafe or coffee shop.

Go to Settings and then tap on [Call → Additional Settings → Caller ID →
Hide Number and it will be blocked].

The phone’s operating system: Go to [Settings → About phone → Updates →
Check for Updates][13]

Individual apps you have installed: Open the [Google Play Store
app], and select My Apps from the side menu.

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_11.53.07_AM_2.png)

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.domobile.applock&hl=en]{._Hyperlink}

[1. Applock for Androids ]

Security needs can arise in simple scenarios, such as keeping prying
eyes out of certain apps. You might hand your phone to someone so they
can make a call or look at a picture. You might be stopped by the police
or have your phone confiscated. Once you turn your back, it's easy for
that user to dig into your data.

Fortunately, there are ways to keep certain applications readily
available while others are locked down. Keeping a password lock on your
phone prevents casual snooping through your contact numbers, texts, and
data. In addition to requiring a passcode to unlock your phone, you can
also download software that allows you to set a code for individual
apps.

We recommend using [AppLock]10 on Androids. AppLock
is a free app that extends your phone’s access controls to specific
applications.

![](/images/applock.png)

![](/images/applock1.png)

Once you download, install, and open AppLock, you will be prompted to
create a password. This is used whenever you re-open AppLock, as well as
when you want to access any of the apps you will be protecting, so make
sure it's a password you can easily remember. You'll also need to
provide a security e-mail address.

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_1.39.56_PM.png)

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_1.39.56_PM1.png)

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_1.40.08_PM1.png)

After that, you are all set to start locking individual apps, such as
Phone, Messenger, Facebook, and so on. If you want to lock the Camera
app, for example, you'll simply tap the lock icon.

Now it is locked, and if you want to access your phone's camera, you
will be prompted to enter your passcode.

[2. DEALING WITH METADATA ON PHOTOS]

Photos we take on all electronic devices can often carry data that can
be used to pinpoint our location and gather other information about us.

This information can be intercepted and gathered as part of the
surveillance of our movements and habits. These details are often shared
through something called[ metadata] which is the
additional details useful to categorizing, locating, or describing a
file. Put simply, metadata refers to data about data.

Many of the files we use and create on our phones have metadata,
including emails, text messages, and photos. So one of the ways we can
secure our phones is by minimizing the metadata our phones share while
we communicate.

The metadata in photographs are known as the [Exchangeable Image File
Format,] or [EXIF.] This can
reveal much about you, your subject, and where a photo was taken.
Metadata embedded in a photo includes the following:

-   Key identifying information, such as camera or cell phone user, GPS
    coordinates, and the time and date the photo was taken.
-   Camera settings, including static information such as the camera
    model and make, and information that varies with each image such as
    orientation (rotation), aperture, shutter speed, focal length,
    metering mode, and ISO speed information.
-   A thumbnail preview of the picture on the camera's LCD screen, in
    file managers, or in photo manipulation software.
-   Descriptions of a photograph's content.
-   Copyright information.

[NOTE:] Different versions of Android may have
different ways to get to the settings described in this section. We
describe the general method but do a little searching around the
settings areas of your particular version of phone to make sure you
achieve the same.

[Switch off Location Tagging for your Camera]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

[Android:] Open the [Camera]
app and tap the circle to the right of the shutter button. From the
resulting menu, tap the [Settings] icon. Now, in
the settings menu, tap the “Location” button. You can tell that
geolocation is now disabled because of the icon overlaid on the options
button.

[INSTALL A Third-Party App for Scrubbing Metadata FROM IMAGES
]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

To remove (“scrub”) existing metadata from images we have taken on our
Androids we can use third-party apps For Android we recommend installing
and using [Exif Eraser].

[Exif Eraser for Android]

After installing Simply pick one or more photos with EXIF information
from Gallery or the app.

Choose whether you want to replace the photo, create a new copy, or
simply share the photo (e.g. to Facebook).

Then, you are free to share your EXIF-free photos without compromising
your privacy.

[1. ACTIVATE YOUR SCREEN Lock]

First, set up a passcode. Some phones also allow you to set your
fingerprint as your password through Touch ID.11 We do not recommend
setting up Touch ID, as you can be physically, unwillingly compelled to
open your device. Instead, simply set a strong PIN.

To set these up, go to [Settings → Touch ID &
Passcode]. On devices without Touch ID, go to
[Settings → Passcode].

Tap [Turn Passcode On]. Then, tap [Passcode
Options] to switch to a four-digit numeric code, a
custom numeric code, or a custom alphanumeric code.

You should choose a code that is at least six digits long. If you have
simple code selected, tap Change Passcode, enter your current code, then
choose a harder sequence. Enter your passcode again to verify and
activate it.

Different versions of iPhones may have different ways to get to the
settings described in this section. We describe the general method but
do a little searching around the settings areas of your particular
version to make sure you achieve the same.

[2. ACTIVATE YOUR SECURITY LOCK TIMER]

Go to the [Settings → Display & Brightness →
Auto-Lock].

[Choose the time interval.] This means that, if you
have not used your phone for the amount of time specified, it will
automatically lock. Do not choose ["Never"], as
that will leave you vulnerable; instead, select an interval [between 30
seconds and one minute].

For maximum security, always choose the shortest possible time frame
that suits you without becoming too taxing. You can always adapt your
times to your activities as well. So if you use your phone for recipes
keep security lock timer off, but then turn it back on when you resume
regular activity. Use your risk assessment to figure out what makes the
most sense for you.

If necessary, you can change it to a longer interval to complete a
specific task, but make sure you change it back!

If you are running iOS 9 or iOS 8, the lock screen option is available
in [Settings → General → Auto-Lock → Time
interval][.]12

[3. iPhone Encryption]

Encryption is essentially one of the best was to protect your phone’s
data if it is stolen, seized, or confiscated. The purpose of encryption
is to ensure that only somebody who is authorized to access data will be
able to read it, using the decryption key.13

[With Androids, you must enable device encryption, but most modern Apple
devices encrypt their contents by default,] with
varying levels of protection. However, to protect yourself from someone
obtaining your data by physically stealing your device, you need to tie
that encryption to a passphrase or code that only you know. The previous
section explains how to set a passcode

Once your passcode is set your phone is now encrypted. What is crucial
is then to [only] back up to your computer or hard
drive and never to icloud. That way you retain maximum control of your

data.

Once you’ve set a passcode, scroll down to the bottom of the Touch ID &
Passcode Settings page. You should see a message reading [“Data
protection is enabled.”] This means that the
device's encryption is now tied to your passcode, and most data on your
phone will require that code to unlock.

[WARNING:] Do not use iCloud to back up your phone.
Always back up your content to a hard drive or your own computer. iCloud
backups allow Apple and other third parties access to your data. For
instance, if they receive a subpoena to release your personal
information to the authorities, there is no guarantee they will be
successful guards of your content. That is a lot of trust to give to a
corporation. Use your risk assessment to decide what is best for you. At
Equality Labs we rarely give our data to corporations for this reason.

[4. Turn off ]

[location Services]

The first time an app tries to access your location it will ask for your
permission, even when it’s running in the background. The app's
developer may also explain how it uses your location.14

Some apps will ask to use your location only while the app is in use. An
app is considered "in use" when you are actively using it in the
foreground or when it's running idly in the background, which the status
bar will indicate.

Other apps will ask for access to your location even when they are not
in use. Your operating system will remind you which apps have this
access with pop-up notifications, triggered when an app uses your
location in the background.

![](/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-17_at_1.27.11_PM1.png)

You can control your phone’s location settings at [Settings → Privacy →
Location Services]. You can turn Location Services
on either during the initial Setup Assistant process or later via the
Location Services screen. After this, you will be able to control which
individual apps and system services have access to your location data.

![](/images/sy_Iphone0016.png)

![](/images/sy_Iphone0017.png)

When Location Services are turned completely off, no apps can use your
location in the foreground or background. This may limit applications
like Maps and GPS requiring services like Uber or Lyft.

With this, you have successfully enabled the Guided Access feature and
can now lock Apps. To do so, open the app you want to lock, for
instance, the Camera app.

Next, [triple-click the home button]. This will
give you options to restrict features within an app, as shown below.
This is the best part of this feature, you may have already seen apps
that lock other applications, but the ability to lock specific features
within an app is new and different. Simply circle any areas of the
screen you would like to make inaccessible.16

We recommend using [PixlMet] to remove (“scrub”)
existing metadata from photos taken with your phone.

-   Key identifying information, such as camera or cell phone user, GPS
    coordinates, and the time and date the photo was taken
-   Camera settings, including static information such as the camera

[PixlMet for iPhones]

This app works the same way. When you choose a photo, it shows you the
saved metadata and allows you to share the photo to social media without
this data.

removes metadata from the copy. The original file remains unmodified in
your photo library.
