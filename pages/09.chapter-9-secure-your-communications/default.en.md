title: 'Chapter 9 - Secure Your Communications'
---

![](/images/SECURE_comunications_1.jpg)

Digital communications is the backbone for all of our organizing work.
Whether it's phone, text, whatsapp or Facebook messenger we are
constantly in communication with each other, our families, and our
movements.

The problem is that almost all of these forms of communications are
easily surveilled. We must maintain habits that safeguard the data
shared when collaborating or working with other communities, activists,
and each other. Encrypted communication protects our right to privacy
when the laws and corporate platforms do not.

That is where [End-to-End Encryption Messaging
(E2EE)] comes in! E2EE is designed to keep
eavesdroppers out of the conversation. Think of it as putting a seal on
the users’ messages, especially as they travel across the social web,
and only the sender and recipient have the tool to break open this seal.
Even companies that own the messaging platform would not have the means
to decrypt the files.

While many apps say they offer E2EE, we give Signal our highest
recommendation because they store the least amount of data and was
developed by progressive developers to explicitly protect the right to
privacy.

WhatsApp, Facebook, and Apple Imessage all offer some form of E2EE but
these corporations still monitor and share the content of your data
while not being transparent about what they would share with a
government agency if you are targeted.

[TO SECURE COMMUNICATION]

they would share with a government agency if you are targeted.

Sometimes these platforms may be the only way to reach people. Implement
Signal where possible but if you must use these other tools only do so
when necessary. We highly recommend you practice risk reduction by
enabling encryption and verifying contacts.

Finally, we want to emphasize that digital communications still comes
second to face to face meetings. However, we do realize this may not be
possible for many collaborations. So, ultimately, we emphasize that the
best security is [discretion]. If you have things
you want confidential then do not say them on communication platforms.
Say only what you feel comfortable having a government official knowing
because you do not know when your communications might be compromised.

[So please be safe and be strategic in what you say, whom you say it to
and when.]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Now let’s explore then how to send End-to-End Encryption Messages on
each of these platforms.

38 [https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-signal-android]{._Hyperlink}

Signal38 is a free and open source communication app for Android and iOS
that employs end-to-end encryption, allowing users to have encrypted
conversations with other Signal users and send end-to-end encrypted
texts, group texts, photos, and video messages. Signal uses your data
connection, so all parties in a Signal communication must have Internet
access on their mobile devices. [Signal users don’t incur SMS and MMS
fees].

You can download Signal as an app on your phone or use it as a browser
extension on your computer.

[Signal for Androids and IPhones]

When you search for the app on your mobile device, make sure to select
the version developed by Open Whisper Systems. Download the app, then
click Install. You’ll see a list of functions, such as TK, that Signal
needs to access in order to work properly.

Click [Accept]. After Signal has finished
downloading, click [Open ]to launch the app.

[INSTALLING SIGNAL AND REGISTERING YOUR NUMBER ]

Register and verify your phone number. You will see a screen that looks
like this:

Enter your mobile phone number and click
[Register]. In order to verify your number, you
will be sent an SMS text with a six-digit code. Since Signal can access
your SMS text messages, it will automatically recognize when you’ve
received the code and complete your registration.

[NOTE:] The guiding screenshots here are from an
Android phone but the procedure is similar for iPhones.

[Making Phone Calls Using Signal]

In order to use Signal, the person you are contacting must also have
Signal for Android or iOS installed. If you use Signal to send a message
to someone who does not use the app, it will send a standard,
non-encrypted text message. If you try to call the person, it will place
a standard phone call. To get started, click the pencil icon in the
lower-right corner of the screen.

You will see a list of all the registered Signal users in your contacts.
You can also enter the phone number of a Signal user who isn’t in your
contacts. When they are selected, you can choose to either call them or
send them a message.

To initiate an encrypted call to a contact, first check to see that the
person can accept Signal calls. Select the contact from your list, then
look for a small padlock icon next to the phone icon. Click the phone
icon to initiate a call.

The most trustworthy way to verify a caller's identity is to use
out-of-band verification to verify the [word pair].
You can also read the words aloud if you recognize the caller’s voice,
although very sophisticated attackers might be able to defeat this. The
word pair must be identical on both users' phones for you to be sure
your message is not being intercepted.

[Signal for COMPUTER—Chrome Extension]

Signal's Google Chrome extension allows you to seamlessly continue text
conversations on both your mobile device and computer. All your
communications will remain encrypted throughout the process. Signal
Private Messenger is a Chrome app that links to your phone, so all
incoming and outgoing messages are displayed consistently on all your
devices. You can comfortably chat using your full desktop or laptop
keyboard.

![](/images/SIGNAL_9.png)

![](/images/SIGNAL_91.png)

Click on Add to Chrome. You will see a scan code, as below.

![](/images/SIGNAL_10.png)

![](/images/SIGNAL_101.png)

Open the Signal app on your phone. Go to [Settings → Linked Devices →

Signal automatically syncs your contacts and messages, so you are good
to go.

[Safety Numbers On—Signal]

Safety numbers allow Signal users to verify the privacy of their
communication with a contact, either by comparing a number or by
scanning a single QR code.

To set this up, open the screen where you are able to message your
contact, as described above. From this screen, tap the name of your
contact at the top of the screen.

On the following screen, tap [Verify Safety
Numbers].

This will take you to a screen with a QR code and a list of "safety
numbers." This code will be unique for every contact. Have your contact
navigate to the corresponding screen for their conversation with you, so
they have a QR code displayed on their screen as well.

Tap [Scan Code]. At this point, Signal may ask for
permission to access the camera. Tap OK.

If verification didn't work, you'll see a notification that says "Failed
to Verify Safety Numbers!"

You may want to avoid [discussing sensitive topics with anyone until you
have verified keys with them].

[NOTE:] Power users the screen displaying your QR
code also has an icon to share your safety numbers in the top-right
corner. It's best to verify contacts in person when possible, but you
may have already authenticated your contact using another secure
application, such as PGP. Since you've already verified your contact,
you can verify safety numbers within Signal without having to be with
your contact in person. In this case, you can share your safety numbers
with that application by tapping the "[share]"
icon, and send your contact your safety numbers.

[Disappearing Messages ON—Signal ]

Signal has a feature called “disappearing messages” that automatically
removes messages from you and your contact's devices after a chosen
period of time after they’ve been seen. To enable disappearing messages
for a conversation, open the screen where you message your contact. From
here, tap the name of the contact at the top of the screen, then tap the
slider next to [Disappearing Messages].

You'll then see a slider that allows you to choose how quickly messages
will disappear.

[[SpiderOak]{._Hyperlink}]() has been a trusted company in the backup
space for almost a decade, known for their [[Zero
Knowledge]{._Hyperlink}]() privacy practices. They have been endorsed by
Edward Snowden in general and specifically as an [[alternative to
Dropbox in October of 2014]{._Hyperlink}[.]{._Hyperlink}]()

Semaphor39 is a real-time team collaboration application created by
SpiderOak intended to provide an experience comparable to products like
HipChat, Slack, or IRC. Because they are Zero Knowledge, it means that
they know nothing about the encrypted data you store on their servers.
Their unique design means nothing leaves your computer until after it is
encrypted and is never decrypted until it is unlocked with your password
on your computer.

Each conversation is cryptographically compartmentalized meaning only
the participants in any given conversation have access to that data or
the encryption keys; however members who join the conversation later can
see content created before their entry into the conversation.

Here is how Semaphor lines up with other similar services in terms of
security provisions.

Semaphor is user-friendly and easy to navigate. You can get it both on
your phone and your computer. Overall, it gives you the ability to
communicate safely and robustly with your colleagues and co-organizers.
The downside is that it is a paid service but we do recommend the
investment.

WhatsApp messenger ([now a subsidiary of Facebook])
is used all around the world, it was one of the first corporate
messaging apps to provide end-to-end encryption by default for all
users.

This makes WhatsApp far safer than other platforms. But keep in mind
WhatsApp still retains the metadata of your chat logs, which reveal who
you were talking with and when. [Additionally, content in WhatsApp helps
to inform your Facebook algorithm and contributes to your Facebook
profile].

So use WhatsApp carefully. First and foremost, make sure all of your
contacts are using the most recent version of WhatsApp, to make sure
encryption is enabled.

Then, it is good practice to authenticate the person you're talking to
in order to make sure it’s really them. Each of your chats has its own
security code used to verify that your calls and messages are end-to-end
encrypted.

This code can be found in the contact info screen, both as a QR code and
a 60-digit number. These codes are unique to each chat and can be
compared between chat participants to verify that the messages you send
are end-to-end encrypted. Security codes are visible versions of the
special key shared between you. Don't worry, the codes don’t represent
the actual key itself; the key is always kept secret.

[WhatsApp]

[NOTE:] The verification process is optional and is
used only to confirm that the messages you send are end-to-end
encrypted.

![](/images/WhatsApp.png)

![](/images/WhatsApp1.png)

To verify that a chat is end-to-end encrypted

Open the chat, tap on your contact's name to open their info screen.

Tap [Encryption ]to view the QR code and the
60-digit number.

If you and your contact are physically next to each other, one of you
can scan the other's QR code or visually compare the 60-digit number. If
you scan the QR code and it is indeed the same, a green checkmark will
appear. Since they match, you can be sure no one is intercepting your
messages or calls.



Facebook Messenger has recently introduced the option to send encrypted
private messages. Since many of us use Messenger to organize protests
and meetings, it is important that we know how to securely use this line
of communication.

[To start a new encrypted conversation:]

Tap the new conversation icon at the top right, then tap [Secret
]in the top-right corner.

[Facebook Messenger]

[WARNING:] Again, please keep in mind that by
turning on Facebook's encrypted messaging you are practicing harm
reduction—[not guaranteeing your complete privacy].
Facebook’s privacy policies leaves much to be desired by activists since
they are willing to hand over [[personal information to
authorities]{.Hyperlink}](https://www.facebook.com/safety/groups/law/guidelines/).
Be safe and practice risk assessment to gauge your level of safety on
this platform.

[What is Encryption?]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Encryption40 as we've explained, is when data is scrambled in such a way
that only someone with the secret password or key can read it. The
scrambling relies on mathematical techniques. These techniques are
powerful enough that even major governments cannot unscramble the data
you choose to encrypt.

[Encryption for personal use]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

When you encrypt data on your computer, it will require a password—also
known as a [private key]—that only you know. This
process is called private key encryption, and it's good for protecting
your data on physical objects that you carry with you such as a USB
drive, phone, or laptop hard drive.

[SENDING SECURE EMAIL USING ENCRYPTION]

41
[https://help.gnome.org/users/seahorse/stable/about-diff-private-public.html.en]{._Hyperlink}

[Encryption to communicate between people]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

There is a dilemma if you want to have secure and private email or
communication between you and your collaborators, and you're the only
one using private key encryption. You can encrypt your data and send it
to your friend, but then you'd need to tell your friend the password so
they can unscramble it. This can be a problem if the government, an ISP,
or a hacker has access to your communications and can overhear or
capture this password/private key.

[Recipient]

[Hello]

[the result of]

[your ][exam...]

[Plaintext]

To address this problem, we use public key encryption. To understand how
this process works, consider the following example:

-   You want to communicate securely to your friend. Instead of sending
    them a private key, you ask your friend to send you a lock that only
    they have the key to. The lock your friend sends is called a public
    key.
-   You receive your friend’s lock, then put your message in a box and
    lock it with that lock.
-   You send the locked box to your friend.
-   Your friend uses their private (secret) key, is paired to the lock
    to unlock it and securely read the message.41

    You may be thinking, "What if a government or hacker hires a
    locksmith to pick the lock?" In this scenario, a [weak encryption
    technique] (low-bit encryption algorithm) would
    represent an easy-to-pick lock that would only take a few minutes to
    break. A [strong encryption algorithm] (known
    as an RSA, which is used in the GPG software package you'll read
    about on the next page), would take a locksmith hundreds of years to
    pick.

    Using a technique like this, you can communicate over an insecure
    network and still have security. The set of mathematical techniques
    that allow this to happen electronically is called [public key
    encryption]. This

    encryption techniques is the basis for all secure communication on
    the Internet, whether it’s HTTPS, GPG, Signal, Tor, or VPNs.46

[USING GPGTOOLS FOR MAC]

GPGTools is a free open-source software package that allows you to use
public key encryption in your communications, primarily over email. You
and your collaborator will both need to have a copy of GPG installed on
your device.

![](/images/GPG.png)

![](/images/GPG1.png)

[NOTE:] To begin using encryption, we recommend
[GPGTools for Mac][ ]and [GNU
Privacy Assistant for PC]. You will learn about
both in the following pages.

How to send encrypted email

Download and install the GPG suite from
[[here]{._Hyperlink}](https://gpgtools.org/)

Create a private and public key pair for your use (in other words,
generate both your lock and your key). You only need to do this once.

On the GPG Keychain program window, click [File → New Key → Enter your
name], your email address and your passphrase.



![](/images/Encryption_03.png)

![](/images/Encryption_031.png)

[PASSPHRASE RULES]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Make sure your passphrase is one you haven't used elsewhere, contains at
least one capital letter, one number, and one special character. [MOST
IMPORTANTLY: MAKE SURE YOU REMEMBER THE
PASSPHRASE].

![](/images/Encryption_04.png)

![](/images/Encryption_041.png)

Next, if you are frequently communicating with new contacts add your key
to the MIT PGP Public Key Server. This is like making sure you’re listed
in the yellow pages of the PGP community. Depending on the extent to
which this key is tied to your personal identity, you may instead choose
to share it directly with people you wish to correspond with, as opposed
to sharing it publicly.

[WARNING:] For initial convenience, jot down your
passphrase on a piece of paper. We strongly recommend that you memorize
your passphrase, then destroy the paper.

To add your key to the server, first you must export it by clicking on
[Export ]in the GPG keychain. Open that file on
your desktop and copy it. Then, go to pgp.mit.edu and enter your key
into the text box under "[Submit a key]" and click
"[Submit this key to the keyserver]! Here you can
also look for other users by searching for names, emails, or specific
key IDs in the "[Search String]" field. Finally,
you can also use the file of your exported key to send your public key
to a collaborator via email.

Once the private/public key pair is created, you will want to publish
your public key on the Internet to a keyserver, so that people who wish
to communicate with you can search for you and find your keys. You can
publish your public key at [https://pgp.mit.edu/]{._Hyperlink}. This is
like making sure you are listed in the yellow pages of the PGP
community. Depending on how tied this key is to your personal identity,
you may choose instead to share it directly with people you wish to

To do so, you'll first export your key by right-clicking on the new key
that appears in the [Key Manager]. Then, select
Key. You will see a notification that says, "[The keys have been copied
to the clipboard]."

Go to [pgp.mit.edu]{._Hyperlink}. There, you can upload your key by
copy-pasting from the clipboard. You can also look for other users by
searching for names, emails, or specific key IDs (as can anyone!).
Finally, you can also use the file of your exported key to send your
public key to collaborator (over email).

[ENCRYPT A MESSAGE]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

In order to encrypt a message, you will need to obtain your
collaborator’s public key. You will use their public key to encrypt your
message, which they will later decrypt using their private key. You can
use the MIT PGP Public Key Server to look up your collaborator’s public
key, if it’s published there.

The keyserver will associate an ID with the key that looks something
like “0x5db78.7” You can make note of this ID and ensure that it is the
correct (authentic) with your collaborator via phone or email. This step
will add an additional layer of security, similar to the two-factor
authentication used in WhatsApp or Gmail. Once you confirm the key, go
ahead and copy it into your clipboard, starting with the line that
begins with “[-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY
BLOCK-----].”

![](/images/GPG_06.png)

![](/images/GPG_061.png)

Once you've copied the key, you can import your collaborator's public
key by clicking “[Import].”

After you’ve imported the public key, you are ready to encrypt a
message. To do so, click on “[Clipboard]" and enter
your message.

![](/images/GPG_07.png)

![](/images/GPG_071.png)

In the clipboard window click on “[encrypt]” and
use your collaborators public key to encrypt. If you check the
“[sign]” box, your message will be
“[signed]” using your key. This way, your
collaborator can verify that the message that is sent is really coming
from you. Your text in the clipboard should transform into an encrypted
block.

You are now ready to send your encrypted email. Copy and paste the
encrypted block into an email or SMS, and send it to your collaborator.

[DECRYPT A MESSAGE]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

When you receive an encrypted message that was sent using your public
key, you can copy that message into the clipboard, hit the [Decrypt

You may want to store a copy of your encryption key on a USB stick for
carrying around. Or, you can back up your private key by going to [Keys
→ Backup]. Your key will be saved to the
appropriate location.

[Using GPG in your Browser]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

With some caveats based on browser security, there are plugins for
Chrome and Firefox to enable OpenPGP encryption for webmail. Mailvelope
([https://www.mailvelope.com/]{._Hyperlink}) provides a relatively
simple option for users who are new to encryption and unable to easily
switch to a different desktop email application. Mailvelope is open
source, audited in 2014, and compatible with most webmail providers,
such as TK or TK. Mailvelope works by adding a button in the
“[compose]” window to open a pop-up window in which
you can write an email. You can then encrypt the message and send only
the encrypted text to the webmail system you primarily use.

[Safer Online Activism 101: Setting Up Social Media Accounts That Can't
be Tracked]

Online activism can leave you vulnerable to trolls and other more
malicious actors who can threaten your online and physical safety
because they disagree with your politics or activism. In the past year,
many activists have shut down online. This means that, sometimes, you
have to position yourself as an anonymous entity in order to TK.

This section will cover how to make accounts that can easily be traced
back to your physical self. In order to create anonymous social media
accounts, you will need services that can generate temporary and
anonymous email addresses, or temporary phone numbers and a secure VPN
network.

First, sign out of all your accounts, close your browser, and restart
your computer. Make sure you are logged in to Tor and/or a secure VPN
network and are using private browsing.

You can then use the following services to generate temporary emails

-   Riseup: [https://user.riseup.net/forms/new\_user/first]{._Hyperlink}
-   Slippery: [https://slippery.email]{._Hyperlink}
-   Guerrilla Mail: [https://www.guerrillamail.com]{._Hyperlink}

These emails self-destruct within a period of days or weeks, which
reduces the chance that accounts created with these emails can be traced
back to you.

Using your new temporary email address, register your anonymous social
media account.

[NOTE:] It is crucial that you use Tor use only
HTTPS sites and are signed out of all other accounts every time you
access an anonymous account you have created.

As we enter this new era, we ask you to apply the same ingenuity we use
to resist in the streets to resist injustice in the digital sphere. By
staying safe—and encouraging others to stay safe—we help ensure the
longevity of our ideologies and movements in domains that are crucial to
our survival as cultures, peoples, and resistances.

As we say goodbye, we would like to say:

[HOLD FAST! COURAGE IS THE ABILITY TO FACE THE DREAD AND NOT LET IT
DEFEAT YOU. WE HAVE LOVE, WE HAVE RESILIENCE, AND WE HAVE ONE
ANOTHER!]

Love,

Equality Labs

[GLOSSARY OF TERMS]

[ActiveX]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

An ActiveX control is a component program object that can be re-used by
many application programs within a computer or among computers in a
network. The technology for creating ActiveX controls is part of
Microsoft's overall ActiveX set of technologies, chief of which is the
Component Object Model (COM). An ActiveX control is roughly equivalent
in concept and implementation to the Java applet.

[Adware/Malware]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Also referred to as malware, sneakware, or spyware, adware is a program
installed without a user's consent or knowledge during the installation
of another program. Much like spyware, adware tracks an individual’s
Internet activity and habits to help companies advertise more
effectively. Adware is usually installed on a computer with free
programs, as the developers are often paid if they include it with their
program. Like spyware, adware can be located and removed from a computer
using software utilities available on the Internet.

[Antivirus program]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

An antivirus program—also known as antivirus software, AVS, antivir, or
just AV—is a software utility designed to protect your computer or
network against computer viruses. If and when a virus is detected, the
computer gives you the option to remove or ignore the infected file, or
move it to the vault.

[APPLICATION]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

A web browser, or simply "browser," is an application used to access and
view websites. Common web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla
Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Apple Safari.

[Browser]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

A web browser, or simply "browser," is an application used to access and
view websites. Common web browsers include Microsoft Internet Explorer,
Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.

[Cookies]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Cookies are TK that may store information such as a session identifier,
user ID, pricing information, user preferences, and more on your web
browser. By changing the value of one of these parameters, an attacker
can obtain additional information from the server, such as a user's
personal or financial information.

[Decryption]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Decryption is the process of converting encoded or encrypted text or
data into text that you or a computer can read and understand. This can
be done manually or with the proper codes or keys.

[Digital Security]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Encrypted data is data that's purposely rendered unreadable by other
humans or computers to prevent access to its contents. It's generated
using an encryption program such as PGP or a simple encryption key, and
it appears as garbage until it is decrypted. Only those who have the
correct password or decryption key can make the data readable again.

[EncryptED DATA]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

The process of making data unreadable by other humans or computers for
the purpose of preventing others from gaining access to its contents.
Encrypted data is generated using an encryption program such as PGP,
encryption machine, or a simple encryption key and appears as garbage
until it is decrypted. To read or use the data, it must be decrypted,
and only those who have the correct password or decryption key can make
the data readable again.

[Firewall]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

A firewall is a software utility or hardware device that limits outside
network access to a computer or local network by blocking or restricting
network ports. Firewalls help prevent unauthorized access to a company
or home network.

[Browsing History]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Web browsing history refers to the list of web pages a user has visited
recently—along with associated data such as page title and time of
visit—which is recorded by web browser software for a certain period of
time. Web browser software does this to provide the user with a back
button and a history list they can use to return to pages they’ve
visited. It also as well as displaying visited links so the user doesn't
have to remember where they’ve been on the web. In addition to the web
browser software itself, third-party services can also record a user's
complete or partial web browsing history. For example, in Google's web
History, registered users clicks are recorded and stored in individual
user histories, each of which are browsable and searchable by that user.

[INCOGNITO MODE]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Also referred to as Private Browsing, InPrivate Browsing, or Private
Window, Incognito mode is a setting that prevents Internet history from
being stored. This means that when you visit any web page, your computer
will not store any text, pictures, cookies, searches, or forms during
your sessions.

[IP Address]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

An Internet Protocol (IP) address is an identifier for a computer or
device on a network. It is a 32-bit numeric address written as four sets
of numbers separated by periods.

[ISP]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

An Internet service provider (ISP) is a company that provides customers
with Internet access. Data may be transmitted using several
technologies, including dial-up, DSL, cable modem, wireless, or
dedicated high-speed interconnects. ISP's also frequently give their
customers email accounts, and offer services including telephone and
television.

[Java]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Java is a programming language expressly designed for use on the
Internet. It was designed to have the "look and feel" of the C++
language, but it is simpler to use than C++ and enforces an
object-oriented programming model. Java can be used to create complete
applications that may run on a single computer or be distributed among
servers and clients in a network. It can also be used to build a small
application module or applet for use as part of a Web page. Applets make
it possible for a Web page user to interact with the page.

[Metadata]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Metadata is data that serves to provide context or additional
information about other data. For example, a document's metadata could
include information about the file's title, subject, author, typeface,
enhancements, and size. It may also describe the conditions under which
the data stored in a database was acquired, its accuracy, date, time,
method of compilation and processing, etc. For example, the government
may have the authority to collect metadata about our phone calls. This
means they cannot collect the actual content of the call, but can
collect metadata like the call's duration, location it was made from and
to, the time of the call, and so on.

[Modem]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

A modem is an electronic device that helps transmit data to or from a
computer via telephone or other communication lines.

[Social media]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Social media is a collection of Internet-based communities that allow
users to interact with one another online. This includes web forums,
wikis, and user-generated content (UGC) websites. However, the term is
most often used to describe popular social networking websites like
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr.
