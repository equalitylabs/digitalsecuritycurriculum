Fam, these are probably going to be some of the hardest years of our
lives. And yes, it is going to get worse before it gets better.

Across the country weíre all waking up and trying to understand what
does the new administration mean for me. What will I lose, who else will
be vulnerable, and yes, how can I fight.

At Equality Labs we believe we must begin the fight by understanding how
we can fight safely, and how to protect ourselves and our
communications.

We must also keep one another close, the strongest defense against Trump
is a collective one rooted in community, self-care and accountability.

We have a president who is a [RAPIST, RACIST, ]and
[ISLAMOPHOBE]. He has done terrible, immoral things
in his past, and now has the power to do many more.

Armed with a Republican-controlled Congress, we do not know how this
administration will address protest. He is an unstable violent man who
now has access to the destructive powers of the National Security Agency
(NSA), the American military, and a nuclear arsenal.

[THINK ABOUT THAT!]

What comes next is beyond all understanding. There is no returning to
the status quo. Our homes, our workplaces, our communitiesóeven our
familiesówill never be the same.

We must fight like our lives depend on it. [Because, in fact they
do.]

This curriculum aims to present immediate common-sense measures to help
activists learn how to protect each other and their movements.

While we are still unsure of what this change will bring, we should
assume that surveillance and censorship will increase, and that the
Trump Administrationís tools and strategies will be more sophisticated
than anything we've seen. These surveillance tools have existed for a
while but were not used to their full potential under the previous Obama
administration.

Additionally, we can expect that individuals fighting for progress will
be targeted now more than ever before. While these prospects are
overwhelming, the good news is that there are strategies and tools
designed to help you avoid most surveillance successfully. We approach
this new surveillance era with caution but also with Knowledge. This
curriculum will help you make informed decisions about protective
measures that can reduce your level of surveillance harm while helping
you navigate new risks as they come up. There will never be a perfect
silver bullet in terms of surveillance evasion but we believe we can
help you feel safer as you organize because you know the tools and you
know your rights.

tools and you know your rights.

Trumpís election campaign showed signs he would take the position of
ìerring on the side of (state) securityî over peopleís rights.1 We know
that he has called for closing parts of the Internet to protect against
ìIslamist propagandaî.2 He was also deeply critical of Apple over its
refusal to unlock an iPhone implicated in a California shooting for the
FBI.3 And we can expect increased efforts to target Black and Brown
communities using databases in predictive policing efforts that use
algorithmic discrimination to go after those that are targets because
they are ìundocumented,î ìgang members,î and/oróìcriminalsî regardless
of whether or not such assumptions are true.

All of these issues must be considered in the context of Trumpís
majority in both houses of Congress. We know there will be members of
his administration who will push harder than ever for ìback doorsî that
allow the government to bypass data security measures like encryption.
They can also easily expand the already bloated phone surveillance
apparatus currently used by the NSA. Trump's words and actions have
suggested that he would push for increased targeting of certain peoples.
He has even suggested the creation of a ìNational Database of Muslims.î4
All of this has the tech world, legal, political experts, activists, and
community members worried.

[We also know many people in our diverse communities feel powerless and
may even argue, ìWhat's the point?î ]But, in fact,
there are simple digital security steps you can take now to help protect
you from most threats, and make the remaining threats very expensive for
malicious actors to implement.

We hope this curriculum will create a foundation for an education in
safety and resilience, and a pathway to bring this crucial conversation
into your homes, organizations, and movements. Digital security is a
process not a destination and we believe that together we can make all
of us safer!
