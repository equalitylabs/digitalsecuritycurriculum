✔ USE A PIN PASSCODE. NEVER USE TOUCH ID. As a Touch ID can be compromised. Make your PIN strong and at least 8 digits. You can find this for Androids under Settings → Personal → Security → Screen Lock.

✔ ENCRYPT AND BACK UP YOUR PHONE. This is automatic with recent versions of Androids. If your device uses Android version 4.0 or newer, you should verify that device encryption is turned on. This can be done in Settings → Personal → Security → Encryption. If it is not follow the steps to encrypt. But just make sure that before starting the encryption process you back up your data, ensure the phone is fully charged and plugged into a power source.
