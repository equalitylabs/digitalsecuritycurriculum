<span style="color:#5157b1">✔ USE A STRONG ANTI-MALWARE SOFTWARE ROUTINELY</span> meaning once a week. We recommend MalwareBytes and check for updates frequently. You can find it here [https://www.malwarebytes.com/](https://www.malwarebytes.com)

<span style="color:#5157b1">✔ DON’T OPEN ATTACHMENTS!</span> This is the main way people get hacked. Don’t believe us, ask the Democratic National Party!  If someone sends you a file on any platform and it is a file that can be opened by Google apps then do it. This includes Word, Excel, PDF, and even some image files. This is because Google can handle malware that might be lurking in such files while your own computer cannot. If it is something you don't feel comfortable uploading to Google then download the file and scan it with your own anti-malware software. But make sure your anti-malware software is updated. Finally, you can also upload the file to virustotal.com and scan it against many anti-virus libraries as an alternative process. 

<span style="color:#5157b1">✔ UPDATE YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM FREQUENTLY.</span> On Macs you can find this at Apple Menu → App Store. On your PC in Windows 10 automate your updates by going to  to Control Panel and check if your automatic updating is turned on. Otherwise follow these steps below:

1. Access the search box in your Windows operating system, type update and then Windows Update.
2. Select Change settings.
3. Click Install updates automatically (recommended), in case it is not already selected.
