These extensions  are crucial for all the browsers you might use and help to ensure you are accessing secure versions of all the sites you visit as well as making sure you can control how sites monitor your usage. 

<span style="color:#3cafa8">✔ WHEN USING A FRIEND’S COMPUTER USE INCOGNITO MODE IN CHROME OR PRIVATE BROWSING IN FIREFOX.</span> This opens a new window in your browser where you can browse the Internet in private without your browser saving the sites you visit. 

Keep in mind though that neither incognito or private browsing Mode won't stop other sources from seeing what sites you’ve visited, including your Internet service provider and the websites you visit themselves.

Additionally, all downloads are saved to your computer’s Downloads folder, even after you close your tabs. You and anyone who uses that computer can see and open the files.

So use wisely.
