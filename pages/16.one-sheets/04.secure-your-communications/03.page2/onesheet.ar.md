The etherpad software does not store IP addresses and will delete itself if it is not used in 30 days. You can also find an alternative to google docs using the open source platform Sandstorm. The platform has lots of open sources apps and while it requires some getting used to, it is one step to helping you wean yourself off of google apps. Learn more at https://Sandstorm.io
