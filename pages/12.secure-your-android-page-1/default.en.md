✔ USE A PIN PASSCODE. NEVER USE TOUCH ID. As a Touch ID can be compromised. Make your PIN strong and at least 8 digits. You can find this for Androids under Settings → Personal → Security → Screen Lock.

<div style="font-family:Arial; color:purple; font-size:14px;" markdown="1">✔ ENCRYPT AND BACK UP YOUR PHONE.</div> This is automatic with recent versions of Androids. If your device uses Android version 4.0 or newer, you should verify that device encryption is turned on. This can be done in Settings → Personal → Security → Encryption. If it is not follow the steps to encrypt. But just make sure that before starting the encryption process you back up your data, ensure the phone is fully charged and plugged into a power source.
 
<div style="font-family:Arial; color:purple; font-size:14px;">✔ SET YOUR SCREEN TO LOCK WHEN NOT UN USE.</div> We recommend that you chose a short amount of time that does not drive you crazy. We use anywhere from 30 sec to a minute. In Android you can find that in  Settings → Personal → Security → Screen Lock. 

<div style="font-family:Arial; color:purple; font-size:14px;">✔ CLEAR YOUR MESSAGE THREADS FREQUENTLY</div> You’ll find this option in your message screen. If your phone is confiscated they can compel you to open it, sensitive content can be exposed from your message history.
