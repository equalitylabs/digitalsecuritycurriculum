At Equality Labs, we believe resistance begins with understanding how we can organize safely, and how to protect ourselves and our communications. We must also keep one another close, the strongest defense against surveillance is a collective one rooted in community, self-care and accountability. This curriculum aims to present immediate common-sense measures to help activists learn how to protect each other and their movements.

Although some countries have privacy protection laws governments can still employ surveillance technologies; lawful or not. Depending on the political climate, such laws can change overnight. Further beyond the state, elements of the right wing are also working to track and harass organizers with the end goal of scaring people from being part of the movement If you are mobilizing against repression, the less information the system has on you the better and this curriculum is designed to show you how.

It's easy to assume that repressive or fascist governments would be the only ones to employ invasive surveillance tools but—that is not the case. we need to consistently protect important data no matter who is in office. For governments have used shocking1 events like wars, climate disasters, economic downturns etc. to increase their power and to suppress opposition by tricking people into giving up their rights. We have witnessed the rolling back of civil liberties by authorities limiting or even outlawing the right to protest. We’ve also seen people respond en masse against dictatorial rule with much success. Digital security will not end repression on its own; but, people must use it to guard data and collective strategies in the process of fighting repression. For where the law has failed in protecting our privacy rights, digital and operational security practices can help us defend them.

We need to have a holistic approach to maintaining privacy when it comes to all countries2. If you are making non-secure communications across borders, you may be putting your contacts or even yourself at risk. It's also important to have constructive conversations with people in your national or international movements who do not have routines around digital security.

This curriculum will help you make informed decisions about protective measures that can reduce harmful levels of surveillance while helping you navigate new risks as they come up. There will never be a perfect silver bullet in terms of digital surveillance, but we believe we can help you feel safer and informed as you organize because you know the tools and you know your rights. Think of it as harm reduction for the digital organizer!

We also know many people in our diverse communities feel powerless and may even argue, “What's the point?”. But in fact, there are simple digital security steps you can take now to help protect you from most threats, and make the remaining threats very expensive for malicious actors to implement.

We hope this curriculum will create a foundation for an education in safety and resilience, and a pathway to bring this crucial conversation into your homes, organizations, and movements. Digital security is a process not a destination and we believe that together we can make all of us safer!

TASKS: When you see this checkmark you should be aware that you are being introduced to a key step that must be completed to ensure the security process being discussed is implemented correctly. Do not proceed to the next security task until you have completed the checkmark at hand as many steps are interdependent of each other.

<div class="GLBL_H2" markdown="1">## THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY</div>

The right to privacy is a powerful and necessary foundation of democracy. When the right to privacy is connected to the right to free speech and the right to assemble we have the three fundamental pillars of any functioning democracy. When any one of these pillars are compromised, democracy itself is at risk.

The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us. These domains include all those things that define our individuality, such as our bodies, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets, and identities. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts of these domains, others—most importantly, state and corporate entities—can access and empowers us to control the extent, manner, and timing of this use.

If a government strips us of privacy in our lives and in our communications, it can halt thoughts, innovations, movements, and political actions that differ from the mainstream. The feeling of being watched over creates a climate of fear that can end up leaving no room for public criticism or dissent. Such environments are not conducive to democracy or social change.

We should expect an unobstructed furthering of the state’s rights in the face of our own.

The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, alludes to the right to privacy, stating that:

“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing

the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”3

The goal of this provision is to protect people’s right to privacy and freedom from arbitrary governmental intrusions. What we currently have in the U.S., is a broken policy framework where the law has failed to protect the rights of certain groups of citizens. Even more drastically, through the frame of “terrorism” the government has an unprecedented ability to surveil anyone who it deems a threat.

If we are really being honest, the right to privacy though has always been for the privileged. Since the U.S. was founded, its government has surveilled, policed, and imprisoned indigenous, black, and other communities of color as part of its policies of state control and to justify its settler colonialism.

From the slave pass, to lantern laws, to predictive policing we have to look at our current mass surveillance state not as an aberration, but rather as the next phase of a continuing policy of state violence toward our communities.

Communities like ours that are in the crosshairs of the current manifestations of mass surveillance must fight even harder for our rights to privacy.

If you are indigenous, black, Muslim, Latinx, undocumented, or LGBTQ you are seen as disposable by the government, your right to privacy has been eroded—or is non-existent.

This increases exponentially if you have been part or are currently in the prison industrial complex.

Now, the whole country is experiencing what those of us from these communities have been saying for a long time:

# SHIT IS REAL Y’ALL, and it’s time to get to work!
