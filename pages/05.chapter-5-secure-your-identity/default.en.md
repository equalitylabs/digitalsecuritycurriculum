We all perform many actions online on a daily basis which increases the
amount of data we leave behind that can be used against us. Securing
your identity means being aware of the locations your data lives, being
aware of the data's vulnerabilities, and learning how you can begin to
implement some very simple changes to ensure your identity remains
protected. Here are some great tips, let’s get started.

[PASSPHRASES REALLY ARE EVERYTHING!]

[Good Passphrases are the Best Defense!]18

A "passphrase" is a long phrase used as a password, which is stronger
than a secular word password. The increased length can allow for a
greater number of possibilities, a passphrases made of randomly-chosen
words can be both easy to remember and hard for someone else to guess,
which is what we want.

Computers are now fast enough to quickly guess passwords shorter than
ten or so characters—and sometimes quite a few more. That means short
passwords of any kind, even totally random ones like nQ\\m=8\*x, or
!s7e&nUY, or gaG5\^bG, may be too weak, especially for settings where an
attacker is able to quickly try an unlimited number of guesses. This is
not necessarily true for an online account, where the speed and quantity
of guesses will be limited, but it could be true in other cases (for
instance, if someone gets ahold of your device and is trying to crack
its encryption password).

[SECURE YOUR IDENTITY]
To learn how to make a good passphrase we are going to follow the
wonderfully easy workflow set up by our friends at the Electronic
Frontier Foundation:

Step 1: Roll five dice all at once. Note the faces that come up without
looking at the wordlist yet. (On our dice, the EFF logo is equivalent to
rolling a one.)

Step 2: Your results might look like this reading left to right: 4, 3,
4, 6, 3. Write those numbers down.

Step 3: Open [[EFF's Long Wordlist
\[.txt\]]{._Hyperlink}](https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt)
to find the corresponding word next to 43463.

Step 4: You will find the word "panoramic." This is the first word in
your passphrase, so write it down.

Step 5: Repeat steps 1–4 five more times to come up with a total of SIX
words.

When you are done, your passphrase may look something like this:

panoramic nectar precut smith banana handclap

Step 6: Come up with your own mnemonic to remember your phrase. It might
be a story, scenario, or sentence that you will be able to remember and
that can remind you of the particular words you chose, in order. For
example:

The panoramic view, as I tasted the nectar of a precut granny smith
apple and banana, deserved a handclap.

Once you have made your passphrase please make sure of the following:

[Keep it secret]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Do not share your passphrase with anyone unless it is absolutely
necessary. And, if you must share a passphrase with a friend, family
member or colleague, you should change it to a temporary passphrase
first, share that one, then change it back when they are done using it.
Often, there are alternatives to sharing a passphrase such as creating a
separate account for each individual who needs access.

[Make it unique]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Avoid using the same passphrase for more than one account. That way if
one passphrase is compromised hackers won't be able to exploit the rest
of your accounts because you used your password for all of your online
services. A good way to keep track of many unique and complex passwords
is to use a password managers like Keepass X, Last Pass and 1pass.

[Keep it fresh]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

Change your passphrase on a regular basis, preferably at least once
every three to six months based on your risk assessment. Some people get
quite attached to a particular passphrase and never change it. This is a
bad idea. The longer you keep one password, the more opportunity others
have to figure it out. Also, if someone is able to use your stolen
password to access your information and services without you knowing
about it, they will continue to do so until you change the password.19

[http://lifehacker.com/5529133/five-best-password-managers]{._Hyperlink}
These days we have accounts with a lot of companies. Emails, Social
media accounts, online bank accounts and so on. One of the most
important things you can do is not use one password for all accounts but
generate different passwords for each of your individual accounts.20

[Now, you might be saying Whhaa???????]{._Bold-ALL-CAPS}

But hear us out. This is actually a good thing. After all, your bank
information is likely linked to many of your accounts, as well as your
purchase history, media browsing habits, and a slew of other private
information that you’d prefer protected. But if you’re the kind of
person who constantly forgets and resets passwords and usernames, or
worse, recycles the same password you’ve been using for the past seven
years, it’s time for a password management tool. If a hacker discovers
your password on a list they can then use it to access every tool in
your life!

Passphrase managers actually become invaluable once you take the first
step—they are an incredibly powerful improvement to your security, while
also being very usable.

Passphrase managers store all your passwords, generate strong ones for
you, and in general, the only password you have to remember is the one
to open your password manager. So, make it a strong one.

[PassPHRASE Manager]

21 [https://lastpass.com/how-it-works/]{._Hyperlink}

[LastPass]

LastPass saves your passwords and gives you secure access from every
computer and mobile device. You only have to remember one password—your
[LastPass]21 master password. Save all your
usernames and passwords to LastPass, and it will auto login to your
sites and sync your passwords everywhere you need them.

The benefit of LastPass is that it is super easy to use across all your
platforms. The problem is that its ease of use comes with the caveat
that LastPass is a corporation and your information is in their cloud.
So balance its ease with your vulnerability and make your decisions for
its use based on that. In general Last Pass is better then no Password
Manager so please consider it

[KEEPASS X]

KeePassX22 Password Safe is another free, open source, lightweight, and
easy-to-use password manager for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, with
ports for Android, iPhone/iPad and other mobile devices. You can
download it for PC’s or Mac’s
[[here]{._Hyperlink}](https://www.keepassx.org/downloads).

The benefits of KeePassX is that it is open source and is part of
constellation of applications built by developers to support software
independence. The challenges with KeePassX is the interface is confusing
for beginners and there is not an easy way to sync KeePassX between your
phone and your computer. That said, if you are willing to do a little
work KeePassX can be one of your safest and most important autonomously
implement password management solutions you could use.

![](/images/KeePass1.png)
[1PASSWORD]

Like other password managers, 1Password enables you to sync your
passwords across all of your devices using the same password vault. It
is available for iOS, macOS, Android, and Windows.

When you first download the app from the App Store, you have to create
an account. Same situation, one password will unlock all of your other
passwords. It's all you need to unlock your confidential world on both
desktop and mobile. [So make it good, and don't forget
it].

That will bring you into a dashboard where all your login information is
stored. Here you can view and manage all the current user names and
passwords you've saved.

The secret to easily managing Logins is in a browser extension. You can
get one for Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Opera.

Every time you're on a website where you need to input login
information, you click this handy extension and tell it to fill in the
information for you. The extension knows what site you're on and
automatically fills in the blank fields.

The extension is also a hub for your whole password experience. In the
drop down that opens, you can copy and paste passwords, view login
information, and make complicated and hard-to-guess new passwords for
all the sites you use.

Now there is no need to remember any passwords, just the one that gets
you into the 1Password app.

![](/images/1PASSWORD_4.png)

![](/images/1PASSWORD_41.png)
![](/images/1PASSWORD_3.png)

![](/images/1PASSWORD_31.png)
The 1Password app has its own built-in browser that can take advantage
of saved passwords, credit card information and more, but with the
addition of Extensions in iOS 8, MobileSafari can use this information
as well.

If on a page with a login or other input field, simply tap the Share
icon, then the iPassword icon. The app will ask for your master
password, then it will fill in the requested information, just as it
does on the Mac.

Apps also exist for Androids that work similarly. We recommend you sync
your data across devices on a secure wi-fi network.

Google's Gmail is one of the most used web email apps in the world. This
section helps us learn how to secure Gmail and how to identify if you
are currently vulnerable. First, let's see whether your account has
already been compromised.

To check for signs of a hack, look at the bottom right hand side. It
will tell you when the last activity on your account took place. Make
sure the dates and times align with your use.

Additionally, you can click on [“Details”] below to
view a list of all the activity on your account.

[GMAIL]
To set your account security for gmail and your google accounts in
general, click on your profile picture on the top of your gmail screen
and click on [“My Account”]

You will be taken to a master settings page. Here you can make sure your
basic settings are set to protect you. Fists, do an overall security
check by clicking on [“Get Started”] under the
[“Security Check Up”] option.

Check that your [recovery phone] or email are
accurate and up-to-date. This will be useful in case you lose your
passwords and entry into your account or if suspicious activity is
detected on your account and Google wants to alert you.

Next, you can check that any recent changes made to the account settings
were in fact made by you from a location you recognize.

Check that the devices from which you access your account look normal.

![](/images/Security_Check-Up_04.png)

![](/images/Security_Check-Up_041.png)
Check that the apps you have allowed access to your gmail account are
there as you specified. We strongly recommend you do not allow access to
random apps that are less secure as they can compromise your security
and gather data about you.

![](/images/Security_Check-Up_05.png)

![](/images/Security_Check-Up_051.png)
Lastly, check your 2-step verification settings and make sure you have
your backup codes. To see more on this, see page 90

Google can collect information on you to send you [“personalized
ads”]. This means that you may get ads that relate
to your recent emails. For example, if you wrote to your mom about
difficulties you were having with your health, Google may start showing
you ads for relevant pharmaceuticals. We strongly recommend you turn
this service off and protect your daily information.

To do this you need to toggle the [“Opt Out”],
switch to the [“OFF”] position.
![](/images/Privacy_Check_Up_04.png)

![](/images/Privacy_Check_Up_041.png)

We recommend you get an [IBA Opt Out Extension] for
your Google Chrome. This tells Google, you have opted out of being
tracked for ads throughout your browser experience.

To install this go to [Chrome → Windows →
Extensions]. Scroll to the bottom of the page and
click on [“Get more Extensions”]. Search for Google
Opt out and Install.

[http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/two-factor-authentication]{._Hyperlink}

Because passwords can be phished, guessed, cracked, or acquired in other
ways (like Keyloggers), you may want to consider adding another barrier
to your accounts through two-factor authentication.

2FA as it's commonly abbreviated, adds an extra step to your basic
log-in procedure. On your frequently visited accounts you typically
enter your username and password once, and then you're done. This is
categorized as a single factor of authentication. When you enable 2FA,
it asks for two factors of authentication.23 This factor can be code or
even a physical dongle connected to your device.

A common example of two-factor authentication is a bank card: the card
itself is the physical item and the personal identification number (PIN)
is the data that goes with it. Including those two elements makes it
more difficult for someone to access the user’s bank account because
they would have to have the physical item in their possession and also
know the PIN.24

Almost all online accounts and platforms not offer two-factor
authentication. You can learn more and slowly implement 2FA by going to
[https://www.turnon2fa.com]{._Hyperlink}. You’ll find tutorials for
almost every platform you can think of and some you would even be
surprised by. In either case you can never go wrong with 2FA so add it
when you can!

[Two Factor Authentication for Gmail (2FA)]

[NOTE:] We will cover two factor authorization for
Twitter and Facebook in the social networking section that follows.

Most people only have—their password—to protect their account. With
2-Step Verification, if someone hacks your password, they will still
need your phone or Security Key to get in.

If turned on, signing in to your account will work a little differently:

Whenever you sign-in to Google, you'll enter your password as usual.

You will be asked for something else. Then, a code will be sent to your
phone via text, voice call, or our mobile app.

To set up 2FA on your gmail account, go to your profile pic/icon on the
top right and click on [“My Account.”], click on
[Sign in and Security]. Then click to [turn 2FA
on].

![](/images/Two_Factor_Authentication_for_Gmail_021.png)

Google will ask you for your phone number to send you the verification
codes. Once you enter the phone number, you will receive a [text with
the secret code].

![](/images/Two_Factor_Authentication_for_Gmail_04.png)

![](/images/Two_Factor_Authentication_for_Gmail_041.png)

![](/images/Two_Factor_Authentication_for_Gmail_06.png)

![](/images/Two_Factor_Authentication_for_Gmail_061.png)

It's a good idea to set up backup codes to access your account when you
don't have your phone at hand. When you click on backup codes, a list of
codes comes up. Save these codes somewhere for future use.

![](/images/Two_Factor_Authentication_for_Gmail_07.png)

![](/images/Two_Factor_Authentication_for_Gmail_08.png)

![](/images/Two_Factor_Authentication_for_Gmail_081.png)

That’s it! Your 2FA has been set up!

If you set up 2-Step Verification using SMS text message or Voice call
and also want to be able to generate codes using an Android, iPhone, or
Blackberry, you can use the Google Authenticator app to receive codes
even if you don’t have an Internet connection or mobile service. Go to
this [[link]{._Hyperlink}](), to set it up.

[WARNING:] 2FA can really protect your account from
being hacked or stolen but bear in mind that setting up 2FA requires
that you provide personal information, like your phone number, other
email addresses etc, that will make these accounts increasingly
traceable to you. In addition, many users find 2FA cumbersome because
every time they login, it's a 2-step process. All factors considered, it
is up to you to make the best decision on 2FA based on your situation
and your needs.

26 [https://www.eff.org/issues/state-sponsored-malware]{._Hyperlink}

When an attacker sends an email or link that looks innocent, but is
actually malicious, it’s called [phishing].
Phishing attacks are a common way that users get infected with malware
(“Malicious Software”)—programs that hide on your computer and can be
used to remotely control it, steal information, or spy on you.25

The vast majority of malware is criminal, aimed at obtaining banking
information or login credentials for email or social media accounts. But
malware is also used by state actors. State intelligence agencies use
malware to carry out covert actions against other states’ computer
systems, such as Flame and Stuxnet. States and state-supporting actors
also use malware to spy on activists, journalists, and dissidents.26

[How can you identify Phishing Schemes?]

The message contains a mismatched URL, or a misleading domain name.

You are asked to send money to cover expenses

[Dealing with Phishing]

The best way to protect yourself from phishing attacks is to never click
on any links or open any attachments sent to your email: this is
unrealistic for most people. So here are some ways to deal.

Be alert. If something about a website doesn’t feel right to you, it may
not be:

-   Check with the friend/family/bank/organization, over phone or
    another channel, to see if they actually did send you the files that
    were sent to you.
-   If you have to frequently send and receive files for work consider
    sending the files through secure servers like Google Drive or
    Dropbox.
Antivirus software are programs that help protect your computer against
most viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, and other unwanted invaders
that can make your computer “sick” by performing malicious acts, such as
deleting files, accessing personal data, or using your computer to
attack other computers. We recommend that you use anti-virus software on
your computer and on your messages. Note, installed software will not be
useful if you do not update it regularly! Updates, keep the anti-virus
on the lookout for the latest types of threats online.

We recommend Malwarebytes, Anti-Malware, Kaspersky labs and SOPHOS
security, along with Windows Defender. These platforms are popular and
used by many which keeps them efficient and more up-to-date than others.

[SO AGAIN NEVER OPEN ATTACHMENTS DIRECTLY ALWAYS OPEN IN GOOGLE DRIVE OR
DOWNLOAD AND THEN SCAN IN VIRUS TOTAL]

[TIPS:] Another tool that is useful to know of is
VirusTotal is a free online service that analyzes files and URL's
enabling the identification of viruses, games, and other kinds of
malicious content detected by antivirus engines and website scanners.
Any user can select a file from their PC or email using their browser
and send it to VirusTotal. However, it is important to note that
VirusTotal is not a substitute for any antivirus/security software
installed since it only scans individual files/URL's on demand.

Everyday in the news, we hear about big corporations or websites getting
hacked and being the bearers of bad news to their users informing them
that their personal information has been stolen by hackers. These data
breaches can include your name, passwords, government ID number, email
address, date of birth, mother’s maiden name, or any other piece of data
you hand over to a website. Data from these breaches are posted on the
Internet for hackers of all types to see. These data leaks are often the
source of bigger political hacks that can compromise movements.

One way to check to see when and where your data has been compromised is
by using [http://haveibeenpwned.com]{._Hyperlink} which is a service
that catalogs data breaches as well as pastes (a type of publishing that
is often used tech nerds and hackers). Be sure to change your passwords
on these sites if you come up on a search.

[Combat Trolling by Finding Your Data Online]

It is important to know where your personal data is online. By searching
your information on the list of sites we have collected you can find and
clear your presence on public data lists.
This can be crucial for when Trolls, stalkers, and worse try to bully
our folks for speaking out, a common strategy they use is Doxxing. In
Doxxing your personal information including addresses, phone numbers,
work information and family members are exposed on public platforms so
that it opens you up to physical harassment and intimidation offline.

We want to stop tactics that might open up you and your loved ones to
attacks. Limiting data is a crucial harm reduction strategy in a time
when we are increasingly being seen as the target.
